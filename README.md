# GetJob Automation Suite

This repository automates your job outreach in four parts:

1. Email campaign from Google Sheets contacts.
2. Delivery verification (bounce/error tracking).
3. LinkedIn outreach automation.
4. Daily job hunter that finds resume-aligned fresher roles and emails links.

The goal is simple: save manual effort and keep your applications moving every day.

## What This Project Does

### 1) Email Campaign (`src/index.js`)
- Reads unsent contacts from Google Sheets.
- Generates subject/body variants using Groq.
- Sends emails in batches via Gmail SMTP.
- Marks sent rows in the sheet.

### 2) Delivery Verification (`scripts/phase5.js`)
- Checks sent emails and bounce notifications using IMAP.
- Detects failed deliveries.
- Writes failure reasons back to Google Sheets.
- Sends a summary report email.

### 3) LinkedIn Outreach (`inb/linkedin_outreach.py`)
- Uses LinkedIn cookie auth.
- Sends connection messages with controlled limits.
- Tracks status in Excel.

### 4) Daily Job Hunter (`daily-job-hunter/index.js`)
- Reads company domains from your target sheet.
- Scrapes careers/job pages aggressively.
- Filters jobs for:
  - resume alignment,
  - fresher-friendly roles,
  - internship + entry-level full-time.
- Stops at 10 unique valid jobs (or timeout).
- Updates the sheet columns:
  - `Domains`
  - `Valid Domain`
  - `scrapped at`
  - `Total found jobs count`
  - `Alligned jobs count`
  - `Email sent with links`
- Emails the 10 links with one-line job summaries.
